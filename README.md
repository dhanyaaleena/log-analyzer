# Log Analyzer - Security Analytics Platform

A simple tool that analyzes web server logs to detect security threats and suspicious activities using machine learning and AI.

**Options:**
- **Live Demo**: Visit the deployed application
- **Local Setup**: Run with Docker

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Live Demo
Visit [https://www.sagestack.org/log-analyzer/](https://www.sagestack.org/log-analyzer/) to test the application.

### Option 2: Run Locally with Docker

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google Gemini API key (optional, for AI-powered threat analysis and explanations)

**To enable AI features:**
1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a `.env` file: `cp env.example .env`
3. Add your API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
4. Restart Docker: `docker-compose restart backend`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhanyaaleena/log-analyzer.git
   cd log-analyzer
   ```

2. **Make the Docker script executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x docker-run.sh
   ```

3. **Set up Google API Key for AI Analysis (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file (in project root, outside Docker)
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Google API key
   # Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   # GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **File Structure:**
   ```
   log-analyzer/
   ├── .env                    ← Create this file here (project root)
   ├── docker-compose.yml
   ├── env.example
   ├── backend/
   ├── frontend/
   └── ...
   ```

4. **Run the Docker setup script**
   ```bash
   ./docker-run.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Build all Docker images with no cache
   - Start PostgreSQL database
   - Initialize database tables automatically
   - Create default user (admin/admin123)
   - Start Flask backend API
   - Start Next.js frontend
   - Show real-time logs

5. **Access the Application**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000/log-analyzer/api/
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL on localhost:5433

6. **Default Login Credentials**
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin123`
   Alternatively Register new account.

**Note**: The Google API key is optional. Without it, the system will still detect threats using machine learning, but won't provide AI-powered explanations and recommendations.

### Test Log Files

The repository includes sample log files for testing:
- **`synthetic_web_logs_100.log`** - 100 
- **`synthetic_web_logs_50.log`** - 50
- **`synthetic_web_logs_500.log`** - 500 testing

These files contain realistic web server logs with embedded security threats including:
- Brute force attacks (multiple 403 errors)
- Automated tools (curl, wget, python scripts)
- Suspicious domains (typosquatting, malicious TLDs)
- Data exfiltration (unusual data transfers)
- Rare domain access patterns

### Docker Management Commands

```bash
# View running containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d

# Access backend container
docker-compose exec backend bash

# Access database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U dbuser -d loganalyzerdb

# Clean up everything (including volumes)
docker-compose down -v && docker system prune -f
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

The Log Analyzer has three main parts:
- **Frontend**: A web dashboard where you can upload logs and view results
- **Backend**: The brain that analyzes logs using AI and machine learning
- **Database**: Stores all your log files and analysis results

## 🤖 How It Detects Threats

The system uses two smart algorithms to find suspicious activities:

#### 1. Pattern Detection
- Finds unusual patterns in your logs
- Detects when something doesn't look normal
- Works like a security guard watching for anything suspicious

#### 2. Behavior Analysis
- Compares current activity with normal behavior
- Spots when someone is acting differently than usual
- Helps catch sneaky attacks that try to blend in

### What It Looks For
The system checks for:
- How often someone visits your site
- What pages they're trying to access
- How much data they're downloading
- What time they're visiting
- Whether they're using suspicious tools

## 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis

The system uses Google's AI to understand threats better:

#### What the AI Does
- Explains what each threat means in simple terms
- Tells you how serious the threat is
- Gives you advice on how to protect yourself
- Creates easy-to-read security reports

#### Example AI Report
```
🚨 THREAT DETECTED:
- Type: Someone trying to break into your admin area
- How Serious: Very High
- What Happened: Same person tried to access admin pages 50 times
- What to Do: Block this person's IP address
```


## 🛡️ Types of Threats It Detects

The system looks for these common attacks:

#### 1. Brute Force Attacks
- Someone trying to guess passwords
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Repeated access to admin pages

#### 2. Automated Tools
- Bots scanning your website
- Automated tools trying to find vulnerabilities
- Scripts downloading your content

#### 3. Suspicious Domains
- Fake websites trying to trick users
- Domains with weird names
- Sites that look like yours but aren't

#### 4. Data Theft
- Someone downloading too much data
- Unusual file access patterns
- Large data transfers at odd times

## 📊 How It Rates Threats

The system gives each threat a confidence score (how sure it is):

#### Threat Levels
- **High (80-100%)**: Very sure this is a real threat
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Pretty sure, but could be wrong
- **Low (40-59%)**: Might be a threat, needs checking

#### What Makes It More Confident
- Multiple signs pointing to the same threat
- Very unusual behavior patterns
- Clear attack signatures
- AI agrees with the machine learning

## 🔍 Types of Attacks It Finds

### 1. Login Attacks
- Someone trying to guess passwords
- Automated login attempts
- Stolen session attacks

### 2. Information Gathering
- Scanning your website for vulnerabilities
- Trying to find hidden files
- Looking for admin pages

### 3. Data Theft
- Downloading large amounts of data
- Accessing files they shouldn't
- Using your API too much

### 4. Malware & Phishing
- Fake websites trying to trick users
- Domains that look like yours
